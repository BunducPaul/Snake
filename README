# Snake :
- the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board.
- as the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger.
- the game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself.
- the goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.
